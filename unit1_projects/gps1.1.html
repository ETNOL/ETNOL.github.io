            <h2>Pair Programming Discussion</h2>
            <h3>Why is pair programming important to DBC?</h3>
            <p>Pairing allows peers to increase their compentencies by sharing their strengths with others.</p>

            <h3>What are driver and navigator roles?</h3>
            <p> These roles will change with every situation. Typically, you'll find a navigator will be
            developing the ideas and concepts of the program while adriver to be focused on crafting the actual code.</p>

            <h2>Pairing reflection</h2>
            <h3>What was it like to pair for the first time?</h3>
            <p>When you're really comfortable with a subject it's difficult to exploit the benefits of
                pair programming, but when you're both thinking things thourgh something more substantial you get the chance
                to use that seperation and the navigator can really be thinking conceptually and don't need to think how it happens
                but how it could happen. With complex subject matter you can really see the benefits.
            </p>

            <h3>Did you enjoy it? What worked? What didn't work?</h3>
            <p> Yeah, it's always enjoyable. It's great finding joy in either producing or teaching through
            the challenges. The navigator often ends up "being the duck" and it's a great feeling to help someone
            solve a big challenge. Having strict boundaries on how something should be accomplished doesn't seem
            to work. It stifles communication and creativity. The best method seems to be using peer pairing to
             open up a dialogue about the task at hand.
