			<h3>Dead End.</h3>
			<p>I did not write this blog post. I did not find a inspiring topic to express any opinion in worth a potential reader's valuable time. On second thought, maybe that is a problem I see in the tech world. The internet is littered with blog posts. Some contain amazing and insightful information and opinions. But there are far too many that are just fodder for the cows, polluting our sea of knowledge. Maybe our industry should respect others' investment of their time greater than we do now.</p>
