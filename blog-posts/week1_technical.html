	The challenge topic for this week is to analyze three of my favorite websites for their visual appeal, purpose, and user experience. I began this challenge by doing some research on each of these three aspects. (This research was Powered by Google so take it with a grain of salt.)
</p>

<p>
	The first site that googling "website visual appeal" brought up was <a href="http://www.measuringusability.com/blog/visual-appeal.php"> this site about...website visual appeal.</a> So I did a quick skim through the article. Two German scientists performed website evaluations and came up with five characteristic pairs that could very accurately predict a website's appeal:</p>
		<ul class="web-appeal-list">
		 	<li>interesting-boring</li>
		 	<li>good use of color-bad use of color</li>
		 	<li>well designed-poorly designed</li>
		 	<li>imaginative-unimaginative</li>
	 	</ul>
<p>What was almost as interesting were the two pairs that <em>did not</em> help predict visual appeal:</p>
	<ul class="web-appeal-list">
		<li>clear-confusing</li>
		<li>simple-complex</li>
	</ul>

<p>
	Another research team found rating a website's appeal could be boiled down to two questions:
</p>
	<ul class="web-appeal-list">
		<li>I found the website to be attractive</li>
		<li>The website has a clear and simple presentation</li>
	</ul>
<p>
	<h3>However...</h3> the most interesting tidbit I picked up from this article is the appearance and usability of a site has a very strong correlation with a user's trust in the site and product.
