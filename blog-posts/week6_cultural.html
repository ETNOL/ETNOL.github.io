			<h2>Stereotype threat</h2>
			<p>This blog post is suppose to be about how stereotype threats have affected me. I'm a tall, white male from suburban Florida. I have plenty of facial hair, am handsome and intelligent enough to be married to my bright and beautiful wife, and wear a size 12 shoe. I don't think stereotypes affect me. This isn't a way of me 'flexing' my life to you. Its my conclusion after considering this possibility over several days.
			</p>
			<p>So, instead, here is my opinion on stereotype threats. They suck. The fear and anxiety of falling into or being part of a stereotype is something I wished no one had to live with.  Drawing assumptions on a person based off their demographic has be happening since the dawn of time. I don't imagine stereotyping people is going to stop until we're all just one vanilla shade of unisex weirdness. </p>
			<p>So what can you and I do about it? I don't believe we can stop stereotyping. Trying to do so would be a waste of energy. I feel this way because I think a stereotype often has at least some underlying truth. Some asians have inherit advantages in mathematics based upon the syntax of their dialect<a href="http://gladwell.com/outliers/rice-paddies-and-math-tests/"> (src)</a>. Women are typically bad at driving <a href="http://www.cracked.com/article_18529_6-absurd-gender-stereotypes-that-science-says-are-true.html"> (src)</a>. I don't feel like drawing assumptions based on a person's attributes alone is wrong. Yet, <em>assuming those assumptions</em> are accurate is a big mistake. Regardless of my opinion of stereotypes, how do we prevent stereotype threat?</p>
			<p>I hope it doesn't surprise you that I do not have a ground-breaking answer to this. I do think we need to continue diversifying our education patterns and practices. I do think we need to continue breaking cultural molds that have formed through the past. And I do think we, as a society, need to continue instilling resilience in our youth as greatly as possible. Oh, and yes, I do have a stereotype threat after all. Ever since I was a young boy, I've always assumed I can't dance.</p>
