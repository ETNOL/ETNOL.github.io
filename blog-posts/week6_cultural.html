			<h2>Stereotype threat</h2>
			<p>This blog post is suppose to be about how stereotype threats have affected me. I'm a tall, white male from suburban Florida. I have plenty of facial hair, am handsome and intelligent enough to be married to my bright and beautiful wife, and wear a size 12 shoe. I don't think stereotypes affect me. This isn't a way of me 'flexing' my life to you. Its simply my conclusion after considering this possibility for several days.
			</p>
			<p>So, instead, here is my opinion on sterotype threats. They suck. The fear and anxiety of falling into or being part of a stereotype is something I wished no one had to live with. But stereotyping, drawing assumptions on a person based solely off their demographic, has certainly be happening since the dawn of time. I don't imagine stereotyping people is going to stop until we're all just one vanilla shade of unisex weirdness. </p>
			<p>So what can be done about it? Modern societies as a whole has been breaking the molds for nearly a century now. And that needs to continue.
