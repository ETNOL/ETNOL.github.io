She says I shouldn't use console warnings to speak. But I don't care what she thinks. Anyways, she is hoarding the cake for herself! We're going to have to shut her down to get it!",
"GlaDOS is going to be hard to hack. She has a system built out of some of the best technologies in the universe! But I've been studying her! I know her moves, her secrets, even her iPhone unlock password! We can beat her! But don't just shut her down! Sadly, we need her to get the cake!",
"Are you ready to beat her at her own game? AWESOME! Ok, here's the plan. First, you'll need to build new components for her. we're going to make them friendly ones that will share the cake instead of those access-holes she has now! I've made a constructor for the new components named FakeComponents(). Start by building a new FakeComponents object!",
"You gotta make the object!!!"

Ok, now we're going to have to carefully swap out her old components for her new ones. But this is the tricky part. Have you seen that system check occuring occasionally? Thats her! Making sure you and I haven't screwed with anything! So we're going to have to act fast!",
		"You can just set GlaDOS to use the new components because she'll notice! But...when she wasn't looking, I made a few methods to bypass her safety system! HAHAHA! TAKE THAT! The functions are called 'inviteClapTrapToParty()', 'tellClapTrapHeIsAwesome()', and 'giveClapTrapIceCream()'.  Run those methods off the GlaDOS object and pass each one the new FakeComponents object as an argument! HURRY!",
		"Did you do it?! OK quick! Run the giveCake function off of GlaDOS before she gets reset!",
		"What happened? Did the system reset before you swapped out all the new components? You have to act fast!!!!"
