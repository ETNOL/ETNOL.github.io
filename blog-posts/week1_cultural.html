				How I feel about DBC? Its a big promise. We're faced with this long, shallow learning curve to a peak that is too cloudy to even make out from the bottom. Our instructors promise they will get us to the top of that mountain as long as we follow their guide. And we promise we'll trust that guidance through to the end.
				I think I'll be very comfortable <em>at</em> DBC. And I mean this in the most literal sense.	I have a bit of fear of life outside of DBC while I attend. The stress of only having a relatively small amount of time to spend with my wife every day will most likely be the most challenging part of the entire experience.

				In the end, no matter the outcome, it will be a story. I thought today, with my hair brushing lightly against the roof of the shower in my tiny Airstream bathroom, "I want the rest of my life to feel like a Wes Anderson movie". I started singing "This Time Tomorrow" in my head and began shaping my sudsy beard into funny shapes while poking my head outside the room to look into the hall mirror.

				I'm certain the future will be delightful.
